Cover with 5 liters of water and bring to a boil.\n\nReduce heat to low and simmer for 3 hours, skimming off any foam that rises to the surface.\n\nRemove the brisket after 1.5 hours, let it cool, then slice thinly and set aside.\n\nStrain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and return to the pot. Add fish sauce, sugar, and salt. Adjust seasonings to taste.\n\nPrepare the noodles according to package instructions.\n\nAssemble the pho: Divide the noodles among bowls. Top with sliced brisket and raw sirloin slices.\n\nLadle the hot broth over the noodles and meat (the hot broth will cook the raw sirloin).\n\nServe with bean sprouts, Thai basil, cilantro, lime wedges, jalape챰os, hoisin sauce, and sriracha on the side.",

    title: "Spanish Seafood Paella",
    description: "A traditional Spanish rice dish loaded with seafood, saffron, and vibrant flavors.",
    ingredients: [
      "300g bomba or arborio rice",
      "1 liter fish stock",
      "1 large pinch saffron threads",
      "3 tbsp olive oil",
      "1 onion, finely chopped",
      "4 cloves garlic, minced",
      "1 red bell pepper, diced",
      "2 tomatoes, diced",
      "1 tsp smoked paprika",
      "200g squid, sliced into rings",
      "12 large shrimp, peeled and deveined",
      "300g mussels, cleaned",
      "200g clams, cleaned",
      "150g firm white fish, cut into chunks",
      "1 cup frozen peas",
      "2 lemons, cut into wedges",
      "Fresh parsley for garnish",
      "Salt and pepper to taste",
    ],
    instructions:
      "Prepare the stock: In a saucepan, warm the fish stock with the saffron threads. Keep it hot but not boiling.\n\nHeat the olive oil in a large paella pan or wide shallow skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the garlic, bell pepper, and tomatoes. Cook for another 5 minutes until the vegetables are soft.\n\nStir in the smoked paprika and rice, coating the rice with the oil and vegetable mixture.\n\nPour in the hot saffron-infused stock and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper. Do not stir after this point.\n\nCook uncovered for 10 minutes over medium heat.\n\nArrange the seafood on top of the rice: first the squid and fish, then after 5 more minutes, add the shrimp, mussels, and clams.\n\nScatter the peas over the top and continue to cook until the rice is tender and the seafood is cooked through, about 10 more minutes. The mussels and clams should open (discard any that don't).\n\nRemove from heat, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let rest for 5 minutes.\n\nGarnish with lemon wedges and fresh parsley before serving.",
